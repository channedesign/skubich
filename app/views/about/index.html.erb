			<p> 
				As far as I can remember, I have always loved creating and working with my own hands. I could stayed confined in my bedroom for days to finish any type of artistic projects. 
				<br>
				I took multiple drawing and creation design classes as I grew up, each one of them were enriching and fulfilling . They made me realize that this is what I wanted to do, this is what I wanted to be. 
				<br>
				<br>
				After four years studying in France I obtained a bachelor degree in Jewelry Design. At "La SEPR Lyon", where Iâ€™ve learned the history of jewelry and the transformation of the techniques through ages as well as studying and using them for my own purpose. 
				<br>
				What I love the most about Jewelry is finding the inspiration in a lots of very different and unusual domain, make it my own then retransform, mix ideas and theme before the realization of the piece itself.
				<br>
				For about three years I have been experiencing, discovering, self teaching and working in various field, trying to express my own personality through jewelry creation.
				<br>
				<br>
				Each piece of jewelry were design and hand made in New York by myself.
				<br>
				And I finally present to you a part of my work.
